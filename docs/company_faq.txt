Remote Work Policy:
Our company operates on a hybrid work model. Employees are encouraged to work from the office on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays to foster collaboration and team cohesion. Mondays and Fridays are designated as flexible remote work days, allowing employees to work from home or another suitable location. For fully remote roles or special circumstances requiring long-term remote arrangements, please refer to the detailed HR Remote Work Policy document available on the company intranet, or contact the Human Resources department directly. All remote work must be approved by a direct manager and requires a signed remote work agreement on file.

Q3 Marketing Campaign Deadline:
The final submission deadline for all Q3 marketing campaign materials, including creative assets, copy, and media plans, is September 15th. All internal reviews must be completed by September 10th to allow for final adjustments. Please upload all finished materials to the 'Q3 Marketing Assets' folder on Google Drive.

Office Hours:
Our standard office hours are Monday to Friday, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time. The reception desk is staffed during these hours. Access outside of these times requires prior approval from department heads or security personnel.

Expense Report Submission:
Expense reports should be submitted through our Concur expense management system no later than the 5th day of the following month (e.g., July expenses due by August 5th). Please ensure all receipts are attached digitally. For questions regarding expense categories or policy, refer to the Finance section on the intranet.
